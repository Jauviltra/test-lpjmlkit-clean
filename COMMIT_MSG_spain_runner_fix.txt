spain: fix runner to use repo grid and write correct config

- Prefer repo-local inputs/grid.bin and inputs/grid.bin.json when present.
- Fix prepare_subset() return handling (use res$csv) to avoid file.exists() errors.
- Use `-DFROM_RESTART` key in simulation params so lpjmlkit writes the FROM_RESTART macro.
- Update documentation (PICKUP_LPJML_v3.md) with the exact WSL command used successfully and a brief changelog.

Notes:
- R/run_spain_with_repo_grid.R is a small wrapper that sets gridbin/grid_json and sources the main runner; it is optional and can be deleted if you want to keep the repo minimal.
- No tmp_run_spain_now.R was found in the repo.
